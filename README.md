## Building the Qt Application from Source

To build and run the **Grades** application from source, it would be best solution to open the application in [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/), then compile it to your liking. But if you want to do it manually, here are the steps you need to follow: 

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Ensure you have Git installed on your system.
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ali-begic/grades
     ```
   - Navigate into the cloned directory:
     ```
     cd grades
     ```

2. **Install Qt Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary Qt libraries, compilers, and build tools installed. Refer to the official Qt documentation for platform-specific instructions:
     - [Qt Documentation for Windows](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/windows-deployment.html)
     - [Qt Documentation for macOS](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/macos-deployment.html)
     - [Qt Documentation for Linux](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/linux-deployment.html)

3. **Configure and Build:**
   - Create a build directory and navigate into it:
     ```
     mkdir build
     cd build
     ```
   - Run `qmake` to generate the Makefile from the `.pro` file:
     ```
     qmake ../src/grades.pro
     ```
   - Compile the application:
      - On Windows with MSVC:
        ```
        nmake
        ```
      - On Windows with MinGW:
        ```
        mingw32-make
        ```
      - On macOS and Linux:
        ```
        make
        ```

4. **Run Your Application:**
   - After a successful build, the executable will be located in the build directory.
   - Run the application:
     ```
     ./grades
     ```
   - On Windows, you can find the executable in the release or debug directory depending on your build configuration.

## Using `windeployqt` for Windows Deployment

To deploy the **Grades** application on Windows, you can use the `windeployqt` tool. This tool automatically copies the necessary Qt runtime files (DLLs, plugins, etc.) to your application's deployment folder, making it easier to distribute the application.

### Steps to Use `windeployqt`:

1. **Build Your Application:**
   - Ensure that your application is fully built using the steps above.

2. **Open the Correct Command Prompt:**
   - Open the "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022" or the "Qt MinGW" command prompt, depending on the compiler you used.

3. **Navigate to the Build Directory:**
   - Use the command prompt to navigate to the directory where your applicationâ€™s executable is located:
     ```bash
     cd ../grades/build/release
     ```

4. **Run `windeployqt`:**
   - Run the following command to deploy your application:
     ```bash
     windeployqt grades.exe
     ```

5. **Test the Deployed Application:**
   - After running `windeployqt`, test the application by running the executable in its deployment directory to ensure all dependencies are correctly deployed.

6. **Distribute the Application:**
   - You can now package the deployed files (including the executable and all copied DLLs and plugins) into a ZIP file, installer, or other distribution formats for distribution.
